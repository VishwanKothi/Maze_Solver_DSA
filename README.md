MAZE SOLVER PROJECT:
To run this  C++ code(in Git Bash), use g++ -o Mazesol Mazesol.cpp and then use ./Mazesol
The code uses chrono package to measure the time.
The code asks, the dimension of the maze(n) which is to be generated, as input.
The code should output:
Generated Maze: A visual representation of the n√ón maze grid, with open paths and barriers which has multiple possible solutions.
Solution Paths: The selected algorithm's paths from the start to the goal(Bfs, Dfs, Dijkstra's and A*), overlaid on the maze.
Performance Metrics: Distance taken by the algorithm to solve the maze, Execution time for solving the maze with the selected algorithm.
Comparison Summary: Comparison showing the efficiency and speed of each algorithm used.
